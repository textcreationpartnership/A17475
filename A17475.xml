            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Aturall reaſon, though it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend much by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and diviſion, yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Futures, ſuch as are the iſſues of warre, it can onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude probably, never demonſtrate ſcientifically. The ſword, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter to it's ſupreame Commander, will not returne to ſheath it ſelfe (what ever man can project to hinder it) till recalled from making ſlaughter by him which firſt gave it Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> having concluded a Peace with <hi>Caeſar</hi> the yeere laſt paſt, conceived withall, that both his Dukedome and the whole Empire ſhould enjoy a firme univerſall Peace, and be no longer plundered by any, either inteſtine or forraine Broyles. But this hope was of no continuance, the Conditions of the Treaty were diſtaſted by the Crowne of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Lantgrave of <hi>Heſſen Caſſell,</hi> Duke <hi>Bernhard</hi> of <hi>Saxon Weymer,</hi> and ſome other Princes of the Empire, and the Electors
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7475:4"/>confederacy, with the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatreſſe of the <hi>Swedes</hi> hoſtility with him.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> ſtood a while as Neutralls, ceaſing from doing offence, either to the Imperiall or Swediſh party, till by the inſtigation of the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> they at laſt came in and bore Armes againſt their late friends and confederates, whoſe powerfull alliance had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe three Princes eſpecially from utter ruine by the Caeſarean Armies. <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> a City famous of late by her miſeries, was the firſt city of importance or note, againſt which the Saxons and Imperialiſts mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: The city was defended valiantly by the Swedes within it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Magdenburg</hi> ſurrendred by the Swedes to the Saxons.</note> for the ſpace of ſixe moneths ſiege, and then their expected ſuccours out of <hi>Swedland</hi> fayling, being hindered by a contrary wind, after that by divers ſallyes they had ſlaine many of their enemies, much weakned the two puiſſent armies which beſieged it, fortified their Fort at <hi>Werben</hi> for their more convenient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the warre in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the march. <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> upon the ſupplications of the diſtreſſed inhabitants rendered it to the Saxons <hi>Iuly</hi> 4/14 upon good tearmes and advantagious conditions, and marched out with their armes and baggage, and two peeces of great Ordnance. The Swediſh gariſon was conducted to <hi>Werben,</hi> and three Saxon Regiments were immediately laid into the city, the inhabitants utterly refuſing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any Imperiall Praeſidiaries.</p>
            <p>The loſſe of this city was ſome prejudice to the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh proceedings, yet their ſtout Commanders, who were reſolved to forge out their owne fortunes, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with their armies, held on play ſtill, ſometimes get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſometimes looſing, till the the maine <hi>Reſt</hi> at <hi>Witſtock</hi> being wonne, againe advanced their cauſe more then this loſſe had ſlackned it. The Lantgrave of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7475:4"/>
               <hi>Heſſen,</hi> who alwayes before ſuſpected the Treaty of <hi>Prague,</hi> and preferred a juſt war before a perilous and diſhonourable Peace: at this time giving care to tearmes of Peace, loſt almoſt his whole countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was aware of it. The Imperiall army under <hi>Goetz, Grava, Gleere,</hi> and other Chieftaines, did not doe him ſo much damage when he ſtood upon his guard, as did his owne ſecurity: He had beene often perſwaded by the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Brunſwicke,</hi> and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Dormſtat,</hi> to entertaine the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles concluded at <hi>Prague,</hi> yet could not be induced thereunto; The Biſhop of <hi>Witzburg</hi> in the end ſent his Agent to the ſame effect, who not prevailing for the Maine, put in for the Bye, a ceſſation from Armes for the ſpace of three weekes betwixt his and the Imperiall Forces, whileſt the Emperour might be wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to ſuch propoſitions as he deſired.</p>
            <p>During the time which he appeared in the Field with his armies, he not onely preſerved the Lantgrave from the fury of the <hi>Caeſareans,</hi> but joyning his Forces with thoſe Swediſh troopes under our brave Countreyman, the Field-Marſhall <hi>Leſle</hi> (whoſe merit and memory, for that, and other his valiant atchieuements, will live to after ages, though the circumſtances of that particular come not within the verge of this conciſe Hiſtory) ſheltered alſo his friends and confederates from the ſtorme which threatned them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hanaw,</hi> a city in the <hi>Weterawe</hi> and nurſery of the Evangelicall Religion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hanaw</hi> relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> and the Field-Marſhall <hi>Leſle</hi> and the ſiege raiſed.</note> was ſtraitly beleaguerd by foure ſeverall Imperiall armies, and he, by the military skill of <hi>Ramſey</hi> the Governour, (a man of whom we may glory, in that his actions there ſpoke him a true <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane,</hi> and no ſtranger to our Engliſh Orbe) defended from the inſulting Enemy which breathed out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt it, and had promiſed himſelfe a glorious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7475:5"/>victory, till the contagion within had deprived him of the one halfe and more of his fellow defendants, and the Imperiall armies without, ſupplyed dayly with freſh men, made him not deſpaire of reliefe, but expect it from abroad.</p>
            <p>In the height of this neceſſity, the Lantgrave having joyned his forces, with the Field-Marſhal <hi>Leſle</hi> put in to ſuccour him; and by the proweſſe of the Commander within, and their happy ſucceſſe without, performed their intent ſo wiſhfully, that the Imperiall armies, without expectation of gaining the city roſe from the ſiege, and diſperſing themſelves ſundry wayes, left it more free then they found it. The Governour, an expert ſouldier, made uſe of his liberty, complyed immediately with the neighbouring city <hi>Frankford,</hi> and ſo prevailed there, by tendring it all obſervant reſpects of Vitinage, that he made it, if not a friend, no enemy, though formerly they had ſtood at tearmes of hoſtility: But thriving men ſeeke as much to enlarge their eſtates, by a new addition, as to enjoy their old ones. To ſtand in a faire correſpondence with that Imperiall city, and to doe no more,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ramſey</hi> brings the neighbour countreys to contribution.</note> 
               <hi>Ramſey</hi> thought it not ſufficient; want of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls during the ſiege, made him know how neceſſary they were, and having engaged the <hi>Frankforders,</hi> not to oppoſe him in his courſe, he then by Armes brought the bordering villages to be his Contributaries.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe of <hi>Crana</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lamboy,</hi> which had formerly beſieged the city, were countermanded by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to attend the Imperiall Generall <hi>Gallas,;</hi> the Countrey neere him was not peſtered with hoſtile Armes, and the Governour apprehending quickly how a fortune was caſt upon him, if he would follow it, invaded the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wertz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and the Territories of the Lantgrave of <hi>Dormſtat,</hi> extorting from them (what they would not have

               </note> the Emperour called an Electorall Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which was long before it began, the Electors delaying their comming thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the appointed time, pretending ſeverall excuſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſundry engagements. The Emperour himſelfe was the firſt that appeared at the place of meeting <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 7. new ſtile, about 7. in the evening he arrived at <hi>Regenſpurg</hi> and was received at the gate of the city by the Magiſtrate, under a Canopy, the people preſent fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon their knees, where he was entertained with an Oration made by the Syndicke of the city, and then rode away in his Coach to the Cathedrall, at the entry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Biſhop met him, did him the like obeiſance which the people had done at the gate, preſented him with his Croſier, which he kiſſed; conducting him firſt into the Church ſinging Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Hymne, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Epiſcopall Palace the place where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty intended to reſide during the firſt Seſſions of the Diet, finding his ſpirits decayed and his ſtrength of body to be abated, though no evident cauſe of his weakeneſſe could be aſſigned. Two dayes after, the Duke of <hi>Bavae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:7475:11"/>pretended the Title of Elector by donation from the Emperour and right of ſucceſſion,<note place="margin">The meeting of the Princes</note> came thither alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companted with his Dutcheſſe, and attended with 500. horſe, to give his Vote in the Electorall affembly; and was lodged as neere the Emperour as might be. The Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> appeared in perſon the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Elector of <hi>Colen</hi> by his deputies the Counts of <hi>Meternick</hi> and <hi>Romſeck:</hi> The Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> tooke up his lodging in an houſe appointed for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> who being under guard at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> was conducted like a priſoner, not a free Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Regenſpurg</hi> about one moneth afterwards, by a Convoy of ſome hundred horſe, commanded by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Collonel called <hi>Gonzaga;</hi> And being arrived at <hi>Donawerth,</hi> as he was upon his journey, he there fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cloyſter called <hi>Saint Croſſe,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Saint Iohns Hill,</hi> in hope in that place, of particular priviledges to remaine free as in a Sanctuary; Vpon Letters received from the Emperour (to whom Collonel <hi>Gonzago</hi> had ſent word thereof) the ſaid Commander did attempt to neglect thoſe priviledges, and would have drawne the Elector out by force: But upon better thoughts and counſell, the Popes Nuncio was imployed unto him, who with faire words and promiſes perſwaded him to come out voluntarily, and ſo he was againe taken and carryed on his journey to <hi>Paſſaw:</hi> Paſſing neere <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> or <hi>Regenſpurg,</hi> he deſired much to bee ſuffered to come in, and to be admitted into the preſence of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors and the Electorall Colledge, but all in vaine. From <hi>Paſſau</hi> he hath bin carried further to <hi>Lintz,</hi> where he yet remaineth; His cauſe having lately bin diſcuſſed, &amp; himſelfe condemned to be diskeyed from his Electorall dignity &amp; Biſhoprick, and to be kept betwixt 4 walls in priſon all the reſt of his life. What from divers places was written concerning this Prince, &amp; particularly that he had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7475:11"/>ſent his Vote in writing to the Colledge, is all a fiction: For knowing that all his Papers and Letters, with his Chancery, were in his enemies hands; whereby did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appeare, what he had treated with forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in prejudice of the Empire, and ſpecially of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> He did not ſtand upon high tearmes of his juſtification, but rather in all humility offer and promiſe his Vote and himſelfe to the Emperours command and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſſe of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> appeared by the Count of <hi>Swartzenburgh</hi> his aſſigne, and the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> his by <hi>Frederick Lebſelder,</hi> his Chamberlaine both by Agents, but not authorized by any commiſsion, as his Deputy in the Electorall negotiation.

To which if you pleaſe to ad the ſuccours of forraign Princes &amp; eſtates, who have already declared themſelves their confederates, &amp; of others who are about to make their like league with them (his Maieſty of great Britt, being reported to have recalled <hi>Leſle</hi> &amp; <hi>Redwin</hi> his ſubjects to no other end than the recovery of the Palatinates by warre) they will appeare no deſpicable enemy. I neede not ſpeak what ſmall hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours you can expect from <hi>G.</hi> D. of <hi>Huneburg</hi> or the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg, Caeſar</hi> having teſtified, that he knowe th not whether they be his friends or enemies, I ſhal conclude briefly, there will not be found in all <hi>Sileſia, Bohemia, Auſtria, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> and <hi>Swaben,</hi> one Imperiall ſouldier to aſsiſt you, if you ſhould receive a new defeate, therefore I beſeech you, rather to labour for a ſettled peace, than a continued War, that ſo theſe miſeries, which have befalne the Empire by this permitious warre, may be removed, <hi>Germany</hi> may againe reiovce to ſee their former tranquillity, the Princes and eſtates of the Empire may be maintained in their rights and priviledges, and no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion (as at this preſent is) laid upon the Electoral dignity.</p>

            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Navy under the command of the Earle of <hi>Harcourt</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> was under ſayle long before the <hi>Neapolitane</hi> Fleete could be ready to incounter them.

            <p>It was a gallant Navy, furniſhed with Artillery in a fit geometricall equipage, the veſſels of 500. tuns, carried each of them 32. pieces of Canon, thoſe of

This happened at <hi>Cape-Ortigall,</hi> thence the Fleete put forward, ſometimes with a faire winde, and ſometimes becalmed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition or diſcovery of any enemy till the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at which time the Navies of the great Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Turſy,</hi> ſent from <hi>Ligorne</hi> under the command of <hi>Melchior Borgia,</hi> to vittaile the Iſlands <hi>Honoria</hi> and <hi>Margarita,</hi> with their perſpectives beholding the gallantry of the French Fleet, and in haſt hoyſed up ſayle, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how unable they were to grapple with ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and well furniſhed Navy, and retired to the port of <hi>Alagon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some pillaging rovers appeared behinde when the French Fleete was gone, and thoſe ſuch onely, as might dammage a Merchant, not encounter with a

            <p>The Fleet as it ſailed along the coaſt of <hi>Provence,</hi> was fortified daily by a new ſupply of Souldiers and Marriners, 100. <hi>Tartanes</hi> veſſels, of the burthen of 500. each carrying 8. land men, &amp; 5.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7475:29"/>places which the amazed people had abandoned, and wrought by this voluntarie humility ſo farre upon the Generall, that he not onely aſſured them of all gentle uſage, but reſtored them the keyes, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to ſeeke out and recall the loſt inhabitants, promiſing to ſecure them from any manner of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which they could expect, or feare might bee offered them by his Army.</p>
            <p>The faire promiſe of the French Admirall,<note place="margin">Monaco is the uſuall name, it is in Liguria.</note> wrought effectually with the poore inhabitants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: they returned quickly upon the credit given to his word, to their ſeveral dwellings. But the ſtrong Port of <hi>Morgnes,</hi> or <hi>Monaco,</hi> ſtood in defiance of his power, and ſhewed all teſtimonies of hoſtility with him. The weather then was calme, and the Navy could not put forth to Sea, and the Count partly to avoid idleneſſe, and partly with deſire to be avenged of the Turke, drew out of the ſhippes ſixe Pieces for battery, and a convenient number of Pioners to make way for his approches thitherward, promiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to winne the place, before any other urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion might call him thence, or the ceſſation of the calme might ſerve the Fleet to undertake an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Sea. The Spaniſh Galleys, (38. in number,) which at that preſent were in the Bay of <hi>Savona,</hi> in the Signiorie of <hi>Genoa,</hi> apprehending that the ſtill face of <hi>Neptune</hi> would bee favourable to their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, which moved better upon the water by the ſtrength of the Oares, then the breath of winde, the next day appeared neere the French Fleete, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with ſome volees of Canon-ſhot to play upon the French Gallions riding at anchor neere <hi>Menton.</hi> This unexpected offer of combat altered the Counts deſigne againſt <hi>Monaco,</hi> his deſire was then to put to Sea, but the ordinary ſhipping was winde-bound,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7475:29"/>and the Galleyes embarred by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Fleete within the Harbour.<note place="margin">Three Sea. fights betwixt the French and Spaniſh Fleets.</note> An unexpected helpe came in this extremity, ſome French Galleyes taking advantage of the calme, made haſte from <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> a Sea-towne in <hi>Liguria,</hi> but under the command of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the French Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado, carried out the Admirals Gallion, who having got ſea-rome, and attended ſtill with theſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come friends, ſpread all his ſailes to recover the little winde that then blew, and in fine, having got the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a breathing ayre, made up to the Spaniſh Galleyes, and diſcharged upon them ſo furiouſly, that one of three, which had gotten neereſt the French Navy, was ſo ſhattered, that her two other attendants were conſtrained to relinquiſh their intended fight with the French men in the Bay, and to wait upon their companion, which was onely buſied in diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her burden of Sea-men and Souldiers, into the other bottomes, fearing leſt they ſhould periſh with the veſſell.</p>
            <p>And now the fight began betwixt the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> thoſe in the Baye, though unable to ſtirre, were not altogether unſerviceable to their confederates abroad at Sea; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleete was betwixt both, and did both gall them both, and was galled on both ſides. Three hours the combate laſted doubtfull, till at the laſt the Patron of <hi>Florence</hi> a galley of 1200 tunne, being ſunke by the <hi>French</hi> Artillery, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Navy in an orderly retreat, made way towards <hi>Genoa,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> by reaſon they wanted thoſe <hi>Daedalian</hi> wings, oares, being for the preſent unable to purſue them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> loſſe, was not great by this battell, nor the <hi>French</hi> atchievements of much conſequence, yet the newes thereof being ſpeedily brought to <hi>Naples,</hi>

            <p>Two houres after the fight neere <hi>Monaco</hi> was ended, a faire gale of wind blew from Weſt-South-Weſt, and then the <hi>French</hi> hoyſed up ſayles to follow the Duke of <hi>Ferandina,</hi> Admirall of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, who rowed by the ſhoare towards <hi>Genoa,</hi> often ſounding for feare of ſplitting the crazed veſſels.

            <p>Both Navies hovered about the <hi>Levant</hi> till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>October,</hi> without attempting any further upon one another, and then they ſeemed to repaire to their winter roads,<note place="margin">The Navyes leave the Sea, and retire to Harbour.</note> thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to <hi>Savona,</hi> thoſe belonging to the great Duke to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> where they reported, the retirement of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleete, to the great joy of the Maritine townes, and the neighbourhood of <hi>Provence,</hi> who with alacritie, of the Nobility, and peaſants, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the weakeneſſe of the enemies in the Iles, joyned themſelves to tenne Regiments, which the Chriſtian King had ſent, to recover <hi>Honoria,</hi> and <hi>Margarita,</hi> promiſing an happy iſſue to their deſigne, but how it proſpered, it is not to be expected in this 4. moneths Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Confederate Armies by land found more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their enterpriſes, then the ſea-men did in their expeditions.

The French expected that the Spaniſh forces would advance towards them, and ſet upon them in their Quarter, and to that purpoſe kept a carefull watch, ſometime ſhewing themſelves before thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which ſtirred not from his Quarter, as if they meant to outbrave him, but moved not thence till they were certified that the Field-Marſhall,<note place="margin">The French remove to the Lomeline.</note> the Count <hi>du Pleſſis Praſlin,</hi> whom the Generall had ſent to the Caſtle <hi>de Fontana,</hi> with 1000. horſe, and as many Muskettiers, to fetch ſoure great Canons which be had left there for his more ſpeedy march, was returned to <hi>Romagnano,</hi> and then becauſe the whole territory thereabouts was waſted by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his and the Spaniſh Armies, himſelfe reſolved to take up his Quarter in the <hi>Lomeline</hi> by <hi>Candy,</hi> neer the Fort of <hi>Breme,</hi> and the Spaniſh Commander for want of forrage, removed his Campe into the centre of <hi>Millanez:</hi> all the Country thereabouts, to wit, that part from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to the principality of <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> on both ſides the River <hi>Taner,</hi> (the <hi>Lomeline</hi> onely excepted whether the French Army was marching) all the <hi>Novarois</hi> from the valley of <hi>Seſia,</hi>

            <p>Three ſeverall inducements moved the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to entrench himſelfe in the <hi>Lomeline:</hi> the firſt was the vicinitie of the royall Fort of <hi>Breme,</hi> which was built by him, at that place,<note place="margin">The royall Fort of Breme built by the Duke of Savoy</note> where the river of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> diſgorgeth himſelfe into <hi>Poe,</hi> betwixt <hi>Caſall</hi> and <hi>Valentia,</hi> and the ſecurity he received thereby for his Army, the Fort commanding both the Rivers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,

            <p>The Caeſarian and Spaniſh forces perceiving how things ſtood, omitted no opportunity, nor left any ſtone unmoved which might ſerve to advance their deſignes.<note place="margin">A treaſonable purpoſe upon Villa-Franca diſcovered and prevented.</note> It was not queſtioned by the enemy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was more lawfull, power or policy, open warre, or private practiſes to attaine their ends.

Hee was a gangrenated member of the Common-wealth, and providence called upon luſtice to uſe her ſword for his reſciſſion, who otherwiſe had expoſed the whole body to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction.</p>
            <p>It is counted a maſter-piece in the Science of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to beate another at his owne weapon, and in warre, to blow up the Miner by his owne worke, or to make uſe of a like project or ſtratagem, to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the firſt deviſer.

The project was not trayterous, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7475:34"/>the Spaniſh Souldiers were not amuzed to betray any of their Soveraignes Forts into the hand of a ſtranger, but to relinquiſh their forcible poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and reſigne it quietly to the right owner. The Prince followed the Dukes directions, and whileſt one part of the Spaniſh Gariſon was abroad without the Caſtle, ſporting after the condition of mad yong blades, the Prince privately brought in ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of his men, whom he prepared for his turne, who cauſed the remainder of the old Gariſon to quit the place with a ſtill ſilence, glad that they could keepe in their tongues when noyſe and clamour might have beene prejudiciall to their lives.

The Gariſon within ſpared no coſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, and if art could doe it, to make it impregnable.

And yet the Duke changed not his firſt counſell, on he went, and about <hi>Iuly</hi> 17/27. ſate downe before it, planted his batteries, blockt up the paſſages, by which the Spaniſh ſuccours ſhould paſſe, and played upon the Citadell with his Artillery, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Sixe weekes the Dukes Forces lay before the Fort, enduring many ſhockes by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Gariſon, which then beginning to be in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, was fortunately relieved in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> by their confederates in the Campe of <hi>Leganez,</hi> who firſt ſent the Colonell <hi>Geldas</hi> with 2000.<note place="margin">Relieved by the Spaniſh Army.</note> horſe, to diſcover the Parmeſans poſture, and afterwards followed himſelfe with the maine body of the Army, to raiſe the ſiege, and relieve the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell.

            <p>And yet before the Army ſhould march forth, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty not relying meerely upon the multitude of his hoſt, nor the ſtrength of his horſes, proclaimed a ſolemne Faſt: wherupon the Romaniſts, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Sorbonne, and the Curates of the ſeverall pariſhes, made prayers for the good ſucceſſe of his Majeſties Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Citie: and the Proteſtants met together at <hi>Charenton</hi> in faithfull devotion for their Soveraigne.

            <p>This ſomewhat abated the feare of the Natives, who now began to gather heart upon diſcovery of the Kings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7475:45"/>care over them, and inverted the deſignes of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Infant, who though he had taken <hi>Corby</hi> before, with as much eaſe as he had done <hi>la Capella</hi> and <hi>Catelet,</hi> by the corruption or cowardiſe of the Governour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants (for though the Lord of <hi>Premi Auguſt</hi> 16. having got ſecretly into the towne, omitted neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties nor good Remonſtrances to perſwade him and the Burgeſſes from rendring it, and the Souldiers both Swedes &amp; French therein, vowed their conſtancie to the King, yet neither of theſe could alter their reſolution from giving up the place) though the Prince had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dared the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> to a ſet battell, which hee wiſely, contrary to the fiery nature of the French, avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, expecting his Maieſties ſuccours; yet upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his Maieſties Armies, yet he now attempted no deſignes, but fell to fortifying the townes hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as intending onely to keep what he had gotten, and not adventure further to enlarge his victories.</p>
            <p>And yet now began the time of action, for the Infant Prince Cardinall ſeeing himſelfe in a ſtrange Territory, and his numbers unequal to thoſe of the Chriſtian King, imployes his Crabats to ſpoyle the countrey, ſent for two new Regiments to the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> imployed his ſpies to diſcover the woods &amp; paſſages, how they were guarded, and where the river was paſſable.

The French Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my incouraged by the Infant Cardinals not preſſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, began now to expect his retrait backward, and in that confidence were divided, the one part under the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7475:45"/>Monſieur, whom his Majeſty returning for a ſhort ſpace to <hi>Chantiley,</hi> had made his Lieutenant Generall for the ſiege of <hi>Roy,</hi> another for <hi>Corby,</hi> under <hi>de la Force,</hi> and the third under the command of the Count <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> to attend the Infant, whoſe numbers were now much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, partly by peſt and famine, and partly by their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the fortification of <hi>Roy, La Capelle, Catelet</hi> and <hi>Corby,</hi> of which they were yet maſters.</p>
            <p>The Monſieur appeared before <hi>Roy, September</hi> 8. 18.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roy</hi> taken by the Monſieur.</note> when and where the Gentry of the kingdome in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable emulation began firſt to ſhew their valour, and to expreſſe that there was nothing they would not dare to doe for their Soveraigne, in the view of the Sonne of <hi>France.</hi> The place being but a little one, could not long hold out; yet ſuch was the fidelitie of the Spaniſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to their Prince, that they endured a whole dayes battery by a dozen Canons, and would not ſurrender it till they perceived a breach in the walles, nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but upon theſe honourable conditions, That the Captaine and the Souldiers ſhould march out with the armes and baggage which they brought into the towne, and bee conducted with a ſafe convoy to their army; which being granted, <hi>Weſlaus Kaye,</hi> governour there for the Emperour, ſurrendred one of the Ports that night, and the towne next morning. The Souldiers had their conditions truely kept; but the Magiſtrate of the place, being a new created one, and one that received his place from the Spaniards, was hanged the 10. 20. of the ſame moneth, and ſome other of the inhabitants accuſed and arreſted for having had correſpondence with the enemy. This was the firſt advantage the <hi>French</hi> had gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cardinall <hi>Infant,</hi> ſince his firſt entry into the kingdome: which though it was not glorious in reſpect of the place, yet was of good conſequence in reſpect of the iſſue. For there was found corne enough to ſupply
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7475:46"/>the whole Armie for many dayes, and the Spaniards were deprived of that ſuſtenance, which might have relieved their preſſing neceſſities.</p>
            <p>The King, who during the ſhort time of his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the army, had given order by a counſell of ſtate, to his Mint-maſters, to enhaunce the price of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, after the rate of gold,<note place="margin">The price of money rayſed in France.</note> from 320 livers to 384, and ſilver from 23 livers and ten ſouſes to 25 livers for the better paiment of his Souldiers.

            <p>
               <hi>Corby</hi> being now in the <hi>Infants</hi> power, was ſtrongly fortified, as being reſerved for a winter quarter, for ſuch Spaniſh Souldiers, who were both able and willing to ſally abroad ſometimes for pillage, and moleſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Picardie.</hi> One thing onely was wanting, convenient hand-mills for grinding of their corne, which neither the Garriſon could make, for want of materials, nor their friends abroad ſupply them with, by reaſon of the circumvallations made about it, though yet farre off by the Kings forces. The onely helpe the Garriſon and towne had, was the Mill at <hi>Fovilloy,</hi> upon the ſide of the Mooraſſe, neere the Citie.

            <p>The Duke <hi>de Chaunes,</hi> Commander for the King in <hi>Amiens,</hi> before the deſigne of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> had conceived a like project for the recovery of the Fort at <hi>Morevill,</hi> from the Spaniards fingers, a place ſtrong for ſituation, and a convenient hold for the invaders, who ſallying

The ſpeech concerning the enterprize, and the proſecution, were almoſt contemporaries, the Embryo was not long in forming, but as ſoone produced, almoſt, as conceived. <hi>Preüil</hi> had his deſire, and the 8.18. he arrived with his followers at the Mill neare the Fort, where he encontred a Corps <hi>du guard</hi> of the enemy, and put them all to the Sword. Thence the forlorn hope conducted by a Serjeant (who was ſlaine by a Muſquet ſhot from the Caſtle) paſſed the Ditches, though in water up to the Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and a Petardior amongſt them fixed his engine of devaſtation to one of the gates, which being fired, made no bigger a breach, than for two men to enter in Front: The Garriſon who had diſcovered the French, uſing their beſt art and meanes to abate the force if they could not altogether prevent and hinder its opperation.</p>
            <p>But the reſt of the adventurers perceiving now this ſmall gap open for their admittance, ran through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to aſsiſt their companions, <hi>Bel-caſtle,</hi> and <hi>Souland,</hi> 2 Gentlemen and Captaines, the firſt of <hi>De Breze</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, the other of <hi>Vigans,</hi> being the firſt that entred, met happily with the Lorraine Captain, the prime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander there, who demanding Quarter, had it given him, but <hi>Preüil</hi> entring immediately with

There needed then no exhortation to encourage his Souldiers, the preſent condition of the French ſouldiers cryed out againſt themſelves, though their tongues were locked up in ſilence.

            <p>How welcome the report of this pety conqueſt (not gotten by a manly fight, but caſt upon the Caeſarean Commander by fortune, as himſelfe told the <hi>Infant</hi> Cardinall) was to the Spaniards, it is to be judged by the Bone-fires which were hereupon made in Flanders, and the reward of 6000 Crownes, which the <hi>Infant</hi> ſent the Baron the next day for this ſervice, by <hi>Charoletto</hi> his Secretary.

But the French proſecuting this beginning, charged the Crabats againe more rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than before, forced them to a diſorderly flight, purſued them to the gates of <hi>Champelite,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept ſhut againſt the fag-end of theſe run-awaies, for feare leſt the French ſhould enter pell-mell with them, expoſed above 100 of them to the ſword, and many to the mercy of the purſuers, who by this time were ingaged with the Avantguard of the Imperiall Army, conſiſting of eight hundred horſe, and beat theſe Caeſareans to their very Palizadoes, with ſome ſlaughter, but more affrightment, many of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers leaving their horſes to ſave themſelves, upon the Mountain, where the Infantery, and Ordinance was placed, others poſting to their trenches, to avoyd the blowes which they met withall in open field. The greateſt loſſe fell upon the Crabats, of whom
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7475:59"/>three hundred were ſlain, as many taken priſons, which loſt all their baggage, even to their very Tents, and Huts, and two thouſand horſes, to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the French Army, and damage of theirs, who living ordinarily by roving and pillaging, were deprived of their horſes, which were of principall uſe in thoſe expeditions. The whole loſſe was valued at more than one hundred thouſand crownes, befides the ranſomes of the Women, amongſt which was <hi>Iſolani's</hi> Miſtreſſe, who with her Caroach and ſix horſes, and Plate, became a prize to the Ritmaſter <hi>Schomborn.</hi>

The Imperiall Army hearing of <hi>Ranzaw's</hi> approach, November 3, new ſtyle, played upon the Town inceſſantly with eight Peeces of Canon, from break of day till three in the afternoon, and then drew out two main Battalions into the meadow, the one whereof was ſent againſt a ſmall breach which their Canon had made in the wall; the other againſt the Terras at the Dijon Gate, a weak peece, defended only by one Horn-work, and without other forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>

The valour of the defendants and the unfitneſſe of the gap for an aſſault, the wall yet ſtanding firme twelve foot high, made the aſſaulters recoyle, who ſeeing their attempt if not deſperate, extremely dangerous, could not be induced by the words and ſtrokes of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to renew their adventure, and go on againe. The Terras was in more danger, and thither upon the retreat of the Imperialiſts, the moſt part of them which were deſigned to make good the gap, haſted to help their copartners, and their comming was ſo happy, that the Battalion there ſeeing a new accrew of oppoſers certified, and their loſſe already in both places of above foure hundred men ſlaine outright, beſides thoſe which were wounded, turned tayle too, and gave over the Enterprize.</p>

               </note> a bird of the ſame feather with <hi>Herwerden,</hi> by name <hi>La Motte</hi> a <hi>Walloon,</hi> and Captaine of a Fregate under the <hi>States,</hi> who being taken by the <hi>Dunkerks,</hi> and clapt in priſon, plotted a way to betray the towne to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and promiſed to performe it, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his enlargement. His project was thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. The <hi>Fregate,</hi> in which he commanded former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being reſtored to him, and armed with a 100 men, he ſayled towards <hi>Calais,</hi> where another Fregate of <hi>Dunkerke</hi> charged onely with foure great peeces, but well furniſhed with Piſtols, and engines for fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, was to attend him, according to his owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The treaſon had beene too palpable, if theſe Bottomes appertained to profeſſed enemies, at the firſt ſhould have greeted each other friendly, and the <hi>States</hi> ſea-men which were in the veſſell being reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him to liberty, might have diſcerned his jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb facs="tcp:7475:66"/>if there a miſt had not beene caſt before their eyes, to conceale his Leger-demaine. To carry it therefore clearely, he made ſome apparance of hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, haled the <hi>Dunkerker,</hi> which making a ſhew as if he meant to fight,<note place="margin">Prepareth to execute his deſigne.</note> put up his waſt-cloathes, and having made ſmall or no reſiſtance, yeelded to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,</hi> (yet he was ſo reputed) immediatly. This done, he writes to his friends at <hi>Vliſſingen</hi> of his prize, tells them that he expected two other Frigates which were comming from <hi>Dunkerke</hi> loaden with the like charge of Armes, and that he hoped very ſpeedily, to bring them all in triumph into that habour. The Statiſh Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began preſently after the ſuppoſed prize, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the action.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> whom he had taken by his feigned fight, were taken into his owne veſſell, and uſed not as priſoners, but friends and confederates, engaged in the ſame action; The <hi>Zealanders</hi> which were ſtill aboard that Fregate (the major part being removed into the <hi>Dunkerker</hi>) began to whiſper to each other, that their Captaines words, and actions did not reſemble each other, and the Captaine whoſe jealous eare, was liſtening to their private conferences, perceiving that his plot was revealed, cauſed the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> to fall upon thoſe with the ſword whom he ſuſpected to have ſmelt out his deſigne, and being by their aſſiſtance cleared of that ſocietie, and aſſured of the reſt, he returnes to the Port of <hi>Dunkerke,</hi> his owne ſhip being covered with the ſayles, that it might not be diſcovered whence it was. Here, hee loaded his owne ſhip with <hi>Dunkerkiſh</hi> ſouldiers, and ſayled thence to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> where 2000. other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were embarqued in ſixe ſeverall Bottomes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, two dayes before his comming thither, the harbour, and the gates of the Citie, having beene kept lockt up, by that ſpace of time, to keepe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
<pb facs="tcp:7475:66"/>private. All this while the irons were but heating, now was the time when they muſt be formed upon the Anvlle; The maine of the deſigne was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto concealed from his confederates; the Admirall <hi>Colart</hi> knew not of it, but in generals, but now being ingaged in the action, he was made acquainted with the particulars, which were, that hee would bring in two of his Frigats into the old Port and ſend the other two into the new one at <hi>Vliſſingen,</hi> and by theſe veſſels, keepe them open, till the Admirall was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the reſt, by whoſe united forces,<note place="margin">And ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Colart</hi> of a double treaſon is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned at <hi>Dunkerke.</hi>
               </note> he doubted not to bring the ſecure City to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The Admirall liſtened to his ſtory, and ſeeming not to apprehend him fully, deſired him to goe into <hi>Oſtend</hi> with him, and that there they would conferre further upon the deſigne. But the Admiralls intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was otherwiſe, he ſuſpected all the Captaines diſcourſe to be like <hi>Sinons</hi> tale, and that he meant not to deliver the City to the hand of the <hi>Dunkerkers,</hi> but that he meant to deliver the <hi>Dunkerkers</hi> into the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the <hi>Vluſhingers,</hi> and having got him to ſhore, arreſted him of a double treaſon, ſent him to <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> and clapt him in irons, wiſely conſidering, that the <hi>Protean</hi> condition of a traytor will conforme it ſelfe to all advantages, and that he which will make no bones to play falſe with his old friends, can giue no aſſurance of remaining firme to his new alliance.</p>
            <p>Thus the linkes of this project falling in peeces of themſelues, the <hi>Vluſhingers</hi> were ridde of that preſent danger before they knew it, yet ſoone after it came to their notice, and then they doubled their guards, and kept a ſtrong watch upon their harbours, to ſecure the City againſt ſuch kinds of unkind undertakers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armie in the field, was the onely thing the United States were now jealous of, but the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy

IV.
